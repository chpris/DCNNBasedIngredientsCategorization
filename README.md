						Food and Ingredients Categorization

Food safety and health is increasingly attracting attentions. People are shifting to vegan diet as vegans are less likely to
develop heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure than meat-eaters. An effective computer vision method to recognize
the dish and ingredients can efficiently help to evaluate to classify the dish as vegan or non-vegan and estimate the amount of calories.
We propose DCNN-based deep architectures for simultaneous learning of ingredient recognition, food categorization, vegan
non-vegan categorization, and calorie estimation. Our algorithm is evaluated using the VIREO Food-172 dataset which comprises of
Chinese food images of highly complex dish appearance. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of ingredient recognition and sheds
light on vegan non-vegan classification and calorie estimation. Our future idea is to improve the accuracy of the architectures and
integrate our system into a real-world mobile application or web-based application to enhance, and improve the accuracy of current
measurements of dietary intake in our practical daily lives.
